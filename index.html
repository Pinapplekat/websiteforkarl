                I began my racing career at a young age, much like many drivers before me. Over the past decade, I’ve
                encountered and overcome a variety of technical and personal challenges that have shaped my growth as a
                driver. Each obstacle has strengthened my resolve and deepened my commitment to the sport. Rather than
                deterring me, these challenges have fueled my determination to reach the highest levels of motorsport.
                With every step, I’ve honed my skills, embraced the learning process, and remained focused on my
                ultimate goal of competing at the top.

                My current ambition is to join an FIA-regulated Formula 4 team, a pivotal step in my journey toward
                becoming a professional racing driver. Formula 4 provides a critical platform for young talent, offering
                the opportunity to refine racecraft, work closely with engineers, and receive invaluable technical
                feedback. It is the ideal environment to transition from competitive racing into a higher level of
                motorsport. This step is not just about performance—it’s about building the discipline, mindset, and
                experience needed to progress to Formula 3 and beyond. Aligning with an F4 team represents both a
                strategic and necessary move in the pursuit of my long-term career goals.

                Born and raised in California, my entry into motorsport began with early races on local tracks, where I
                quickly developed a passion for competition and performance. That passion was sparked by my father, a
                former rally driver from Denmark, whose experience and guidance played a key role in shaping my path.
                From a young age, he served not only as an inspiration but also as a mentor—instilling in me the
                fundamentals of racecraft, focus, and commitment. These early experiences laid the groundwork for my
                continued development as a driver, and they remain central to the discipline and ambition I bring to
                every stage of my racing career.
